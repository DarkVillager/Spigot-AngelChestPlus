Complete GUI for your AngelChests with configurable buttons etc.
GUI can automatically be opened after death
Option to automatically unlock protected chests after a specific amount of time
You can set different materials for protected and unprotected chests if you wish to
The protected/unprotected status can also be shown in the hologram, including a countdown for automatic unlocking

Option to preview chest contents in the GUI
Option to open a chest with shift+rightclick to only take certain items instead of looting everything
Ability to show AngelChest's owner a message when other players open or empty their chest
dont-protect-chest-if-player-died-in-pvp
allow-chest-in-lava / allow-chest-in-void
collect-xp (can also be set to "nopvp" so experience will drop normally during PvP deaths) (free version always collects vanilla amount)
Ability to log all AngelChest spawns / transactions to separate files
Option to spawn the chest with a specific chance only (e.g. setting it to 0.5 means you have a 50/50 chance of having an AngelChest spawned on death)
Per group prices for fetch / teleport / chest spawning / chest opening including using percentages of the player's bank account balance
Configurable amount of xp loss (percentage) per group
More control over the holograms (only {protected} right now, might have to add {deathCause} too)
