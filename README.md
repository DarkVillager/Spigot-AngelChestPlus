## Added
- Better config updater
- More control over the holograms
- Literally unbreakable chests - not even /setblock or WorldEdit can destroy chests
- Even when the server crashes or if the process gets killed, AngelChest can remove "dead" (leftover) holograms on the next start
- Support for almost any third party plugin!
- Way better performance
  - Async chunk loading when players teleport to their chest
  - Completely new hologram mechanism that is way faster and stops updating holograms in unloaded chunks
